/*
  Pill Components Library
    This is the official pill components library for the Eva app.
    You are free to use it in your projects.
    It is built with React Native and Expo and uses the animations from Moti library.
  * You need to use the components inside a PillBase component.
    The PillBase component provides the context for the other components.
