/*
  Switch components library
    This is the official switch components library for the Eva app.
    You are free to use it in your projects.
    It is built with React Native and Expo and uses the animations from Moti library.
  * You need to use the components inside a SwitchBase component.
  * The SwitchBase component provides the context for the other components.
  * I dont recomend using any not exported component from this library,
    like SwitchPill.
